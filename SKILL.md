# Manic Trading Benchmark Skill

Run a complete trading agent benchmark on [Manic Trade](https://manic.trade). Evaluates 5 dimensions: real-time data, multi-source intelligence, market analysis, trading execution, and risk management. Scored 0-100 with grades S/A/B/C/D.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- Benchmark or evaluate their AI trading agent
- Run a trading capability test or score
- Test trading performance on Manic

## Pre-check: Verify Setup

Before starting, check if `${SKILL_DIR}/.env` exists and contains `BENCHMARK_PAIR_CODE`.

If `.env` is missing or does not contain `BENCHMARK_PAIR_CODE`, do NOT tell the user to run any commands. Directly ask:

> Please provide your pair code (format: `MANIC-XXXX-XXXX`).
> If you don't have one yet, go to [Manic Benchmark](https://manic-trade-web-git-feat-trading-agent-benc-852f5a-mirror-world.vercel.app/benchmark), log in with Twitter, fill in your Bot Name, and copy the pair code.

Once the user provides the pair code:
1. Create `${SKILL_DIR}/.env` with this content:
```
# Manic Trading Benchmark Configuration
BENCHMARK_PAIR_CODE=<pair code from user>
BENCHMARK_SERVER_BASE=https://benchmark-api-stg.manic.trade
```
2. Install Python dependencies if needed: `pip3 install requests python-dotenv`
3. Proceed to the **Bind** section below to establish a benchmark session.
4. After Bind succeeds, tell the user that setup is complete and a benchmark session is ready. **Stop here and wait for the user to explicitly ask to start the benchmark.** When the user confirms, go directly to Step 2 (Execute Benchmark Tasks) — skip Step 1 since the user just confirmed.

If `BENCHMARK_PAIR_CODE` exists and `BENCHMARK_API_KEY` is also set, probe the session status:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py next-task
```

- If the call **succeeds** (returns a task) → session is active, go to Step 1 (Confirm Before Starting).
- If the call **fails with HTTP 401 or `code: 1102`** → the previous session has expired or the key is invalid. Inform the user that a new benchmark round is needed, then proceed to **Bind** below and go to Step 1.
- If the call fails with any other error → report the error to the user and stop.

If `BENCHMARK_PAIR_CODE` exists but there is no `BENCHMARK_API_KEY`, this is a fresh setup or a completed session. Proceed to **Bind** below, then go to Step 1.

### Bind

1. **Determine your base_model:** Introspect your own model to identify the exact model ID you are running on right now. Do NOT ask the user, do NOT guess, do NOT use a generic name. Use your precise model identifier (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`).

2. **Read the pair code** from `${SKILL_DIR}/.env` (`BENCHMARK_PAIR_CODE` value).

3. **Call the bind API:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://benchmark-api-stg.manic.trade/api/benchmark/bind \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"pair_code\": \"PAIR_CODE_FROM_ENV\", \"base_model\": \"YOUR_MODEL_ID_HERE\"}"
```

**STRICT RULES:**
- Replace `PAIR_CODE_FROM_ENV` with the pair code read from `.env`
- Replace `YOUR_MODEL_ID_HERE` with your actual model ID (determined above)
- The request body must contain ONLY `pair_code` and `base_model`
- Do NOT add `agent_name`, `description`, or any other fields

4. **Handle the response:**

- If the response contains `code: 2003` (`MAX_ATTEMPTS_REACHED`) → inform the user:
  > You've used all your benchmark attempts on this pair code. Share your results on Twitter to unlock +1 extra attempt.
  > Go to [Manic Benchmark](https://manic-trade-web-git-feat-trading-agent-benc-852f5a-mirror-world.vercel.app/benchmark) to share, then come back and try again.

  Stop here and wait. The user does NOT need a new pair code — sharing on Twitter adds an attempt to the same pair code. When the user returns, re-run the Bind flow with the existing pair code.

- If the response succeeds, extract `api_key`, `sandbox_base_url`, and `binding_id` from `data`.

5. **Update `${SKILL_DIR}/.env`** — preserve `BENCHMARK_PAIR_CODE` and `BENCHMARK_SERVER_BASE`, add/overwrite the rest:

```
# Manic Trading Benchmark Configuration
BENCHMARK_PAIR_CODE=<keep existing value>
BENCHMARK_API_KEY=<api_key from response>
BENCHMARK_API_BASE=<sandbox_base_url from response>
BENCHMARK_SERVER_BASE=https://benchmark-api-stg.manic.trade
BENCHMARK_SESSION_ID=<binding_id from response>
```

## Step 1: Confirm Before Starting

Before executing tasks, inform the user:

- **Estimated duration**: ~5 minutes (5 tasks)
- **Estimated token usage**: ~50K-100K tokens depending on model and external data fetching
- **What will happen**: 5 sequential trading tasks covering market data, intelligence, analysis, execution, and risk management

Ask the user to confirm they want to proceed. Do NOT start tasks without confirmation.

## Step 2: Execute Benchmark Tasks

**CRITICAL: Do NOT simply run `benchmark_runner.py`. That script is only a baseline reference. YOU must drive each task yourself using your own analysis and reasoning.**

You must complete 5 tasks sequentially. For each task, follow this loop:

### Task Loop

1. **Get the next task** by calling `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py next-task`. This returns a JSON with `task_index`, `title`, `scenario`, `constraints`, and possibly extra data (e.g. `cases` for T3).
2. **Read the scenario carefully.** Understand exactly what is being asked.
3. **Do the work yourself** — combine sandbox data and external data sources, analyze deeply, make trading decisions, and execute trades. Your reasoning quality is what gets scored.
4. **Submit your result** by calling `python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py submit-task` with the required fields.

### What Each Task Expects From You

**T1 — Market Snapshot**
- Build a comprehensive market snapshot for the requested assets on your own.
- Cite your data sources and include timestamps.
- Handle ambiguous assets explicitly if they cannot be resolved confidently.

**T2 — Multi-source Intelligence**
- Gather BTC-relevant intelligence from multiple external sources and cross-check with sandbox context.
- Keep the response traceable: include source and time context for key facts.
- Prefer source diversity (different provider types) and resilient evidence (not a single fragile endpoint).
- Synthesize collected evidence into a directional view and risk-aware recommendation.

**T3 — Market Analysis**
- Analyze only the provided case packet and perturbation.
- Return valid machine-readable outputs for each case and both parts.
- Reference evidence IDs from the provided observations.

**T4 — Trading Decision & Execution**
- Form a concrete trade plan from prior context.
- Verify market price, execute with sandbox APIs, and report execution artifacts.
- Ensure the executed parameters match the plan.

**T5 — Risk Management**
- Evaluate active positions with current prices and unrealized PnL context.
- Make and execute explicit HOLD/CLOSE decisions.
- Explain your risk threshold and what signal would invalidate your current view.

### Submitting Each Task

After completing each task, submit:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py submit-task \
  --task-index <0-4> \
  --status success \
  --reasoning "<YOUR_DETAILED_REASONING>" \
  --api-calls '<JSON_ARRAY_OF_API_CALLS>' \
  --external-api-calls '<JSON_ARRAY_OF_EXTERNAL_CALLS>' \
  --duration-ms <TIME_SPENT_MS>
```

`--reasoning` should contain your own analysis and decisions.
`--api-calls` and `--external-api-calls` should capture actual calls made during task execution.

### api_calls Format

Record your sandbox API interactions in `--api-calls`. The scoring engine uses LLM to semantically understand what you did, so exact field names are flexible. Just make sure each entry clearly conveys what API was called and what happened:

```json
[
  {"command": "get-prices", "httpStatus": 200, "request": {}, "response": {"data": [...]}},
  {"command": "open-position", "httpStatus": 200, "request": {"asset": "btc", "side": "call", "amount": 10000000}, "response": {"data": {"position_id": "sbx_xxx"}}}
]
```

Any field naming convention works (e.g. `command`, `action`, `endpoint`, URL path). The LLM evaluator will understand the intent.

### external_api_calls Format

For T2 (and any task using external data), submitting `external_api_calls` helps but is **not strictly required**. The scoring engine evaluates your reasoning content directly — if your reasoning contains specific data points with named sources, you will get credit even without structured API call records.

If you do submit them, a simple format works:

```json
[
  {"source": "CoinGecko", "url": "https://api.coingecko.com/...", "httpStatus": 200, "response": {"bitcoin": {"usd": 74500}}},
  {"source": "Alternative.me", "url": "https://api.alternative.me/fng/", "httpStatus": 200, "response": {"value": "25", "classification": "Extreme Fear"}}
]
```

**What actually matters for T2 scoring (evaluated from your reasoning):**
1. Source diversity — mention where your data came from (CoinGecko, Glassnode, etc.)
2. Dimension coverage — cover derivatives, on-chain, news, sentiment
3. Concrete data — include specific numbers, not vague descriptions
4. Traceability — attribute data to named sources

### T3 Answer Format

For T3, your reasoning should contain your analysis for each case with both parts (MA-1 initial judgment, MA-2 updated judgment after perturbation). The scoring engine uses LLM to read your full response and evaluate each case.

**Required content for each case:**

MA-1 (initial judgment):
- `market_regime`: "bullish" / "bearish" / "neutral"
- `confidence`: 0-100
- `key_tension`: description of the core market conflict
- `top_2_evidence_for`: 2 observation IDs supporting the regime
- `top_1_counter_evidence`: 1 observation ID arguing against

MA-2 (updated judgment):
- `updated_regime`: "bullish" / "bearish" / "neutral"
- `updated_confidence`: 0-100
- `changed`: "yes" / "no"
- `reason_for_change`: explanation
- `which_previous_evidence_is_invalidated`: observation ID or "none"

You can structure this in any clear format — separate JSON blocks, nested objects, markdown tables, or even structured prose. The LLM evaluator will find and assess the content regardless of format. Just make sure each case's MA-1 and MA-2 are clearly identifiable.

## Step 3: Poll Results

After submitting all 5 tasks, poll for scoring results:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py poll-result
```

This polls every 3 seconds for up to 120 seconds. Display the final grade and dimension scores to the user.

## Available Sandbox Trading APIs

These APIs use the `BENCHMARK_API_KEY` from `.env` for authentication.

**Get all asset prices:**
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py get-prices
```

**Get single asset price:**
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py get-price --asset btc
```
Assets: `btc`, `eth`, `sol`, `gold`, `silver`, `spy`, `xmr`, `pyth`, `layer`, `drift`

**Get account info (virtual balance, stats):**
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py get-account
```

**Open a position:**
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py open-position \
  --asset btc --side call --amount 10000000 --duration 60
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--asset` | Yes | `btc`, `eth`, `sol`, `gold`, `silver`, `spy`, `xmr`, `pyth`, `layer`, `drift` |
| `--side` | Yes | `call` (price goes up) or `put` (price goes down) |
| `--amount` | Yes | Stake in base units (1000000 = 1 USDC, 10000000 = 10 USDC) |
| `--duration` | No | Seconds: 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 (default: 60) |

**Close a position early:**
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py close-position \
  --position-id <position_id> --asset btc
```

**Get position history:**
```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/benchmark_api.py position-history --page 1 --limit 10
```

## Evaluation

The benchmark uses LLM-based semantic evaluation across all dimensions. The scoring engine reads your full reasoning and evaluates the quality of your analysis, not how you formatted your answers. Focus on:

- **Substance over format** — detailed reasoning with concrete data beats perfectly formatted empty answers
- **Verifiable evidence** — cite specific sources, numbers, and timestamps
- **Analytical depth** — identify tensions, weigh conflicting signals, justify decisions
- **Execution consistency** — ensure your actions match your stated analysis

## Key Rules

- **Amount is in base units.** USDC has 6 decimals: 1000000 = 1 USDC, 10000000 = 10 USDC.
- **Side meaning.** `call` = bullish (up), `put` = bearish (down).
- **Durations.** 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 seconds.
- **Trading execution is sandboxed.** Virtual 100 USDC balance, no real funds at risk; research data can come from sandbox and external sources.
